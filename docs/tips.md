## Use from Vim

If you [install Shiba with npm](installation.md), `shiba` command is available to start Shiba from Vim.  Neither Vim plugin nor specific configuration is needed.  Simply run below command in your Vim.

```sh
:!shiba --detach %
```

Shiba opens the window and starts to watch and preview the current buffer.
