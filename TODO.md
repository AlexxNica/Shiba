- Refactoring
  - [x] Remove useless id in DOM tags
  - [x] Enable --noImplicitAny
  - [x] Update dependencies
  - [x] Change directory layout
  - [ ] Run test with electron-mocha(main process) and nightmare.js(renderer process).
  - [ ] Watcher notifies the name of changed file and event name from main process, then linter and markdown conversion should work in renderer process, in order to avoid sending file content via IPC.
- Tab
  - [ ] Move menu to left side of the window
  - [ ] Refactor watcher to watch multiple files
  - [ ] Add tabs into the menu
- Hidden title bar
  - [ ] Use OS X hidden title bar with inset. I must consider that title is also removed.
